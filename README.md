# Simulation-python

Hello and welcome!
My name is Josué Weiss, and I am currently a physics student at the University of Strasbourg.

This repository is a personal collection of Python projects related to computational physics.
It focuses primarily on:
	•	Scientific simulations,
	•	Numerical solutions of differential equations,
	•	Implementation of classical and modern numerical techniques,
	•	Use of scientific computing libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy).
